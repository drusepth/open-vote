# Voting system usability

* Voting should be available to all citizens capable of voting, regardless of
  their means, possessions, and capabilities.

## Vote vectors

* Expect most voters to cast their votes via an online voting system, managed
  by the federal government in cooperation with an open source, online
  community. [Authentication TBD]

* Voters that do not wish to vote online may also vote in person via electronic
  voting machines stationed at the usual voting locations.
  
* Voters away from their registered voting location and without internet may
  vote via absentee ballot through the postal system.
