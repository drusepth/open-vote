# Vote Verifiability

Three aspects of verifiability should be guaranteed in this system to ensure
confidence in electronic, online voting.

1. *Individual verifiability* allows a voter to check that her own vote is
   included in the election outcom.
2. *Universal verifiability* allows voters or election observers to check that
   the election outcome corresponds to the votes cast.
3. *Eligibility verifiability* allows voters and observers to check that each
   vote in the election outcome was cast by a uniquely registered voter.

# Individual verifiability
